// As you know Kira and L are rivals. But Kira has advantage i.e. The Deathnote. But L is really smart. They're playing a game you need to predict who will win.

// The game have following rules:

// Initially, they have an integer sequence A1,A2,…,AN; in addition, Kira chooses some number a and L chooses some number b.
// The players alternate turns. In each turn, the current player must remove a non-zero number of elements from the sequence; each removed element should be a multiple of the chosen number by this player.
// If it is impossible to remove any elements, the current player loses the game.

// It is clear that one player wins the game after a finite number of turns. Find the winner of the game if Kira plays first and both Kira and L play optimally.

// Input Format

// The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
// The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, a and b.
// The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

// Constraints:

// 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
// 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
// 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 1003
// 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000 for each valid i

// Output Format:

// For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Kira" if the winner is Kira or "L" if the winner is L (without quotes).


// Sample Input 0:

// 2
// 5 3 2
// 1 2 3 4 5
// 5 2 4
// 1 2 3 4 5


// Sample Output 0:
// L
// Kira


// First Test case :
// Kira removes 3 and the sequence becomes [1,2,4,5]. Then, L removes 2 and the sequence becomes [1,4,5]. Now, Kira is left with no moves, so L is the winner.
// Second Test case :
// Kira removes [2, 4] and the sequence becomes [1, 3, 5]. Now, L is left with no moves, so Kira is the winner.
